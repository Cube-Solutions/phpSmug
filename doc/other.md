# Other Notes

## Access SmugMug via a Proxy

# Examples

phpSmug comes with 3 examples to help get you on your way. All 3 examples perform the same thing, just using differing authentication methods. They all show thumbnails of the first album found for the respective authentication methods:

- `example.php` illustrates anonymous, unauthenticated access.
- `example-oauth.php` illustrates an OAuth login.
- `example-external-links.php` illustrates displaying private images.

And thatâ€™s all folks.
