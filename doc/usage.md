## Autoload

`phpSmug` follows the PSR-1, PSR-2 and PSR-4 conventions, which means you can easily use Composer's [autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) to integrate `phpSmug` into your projects.

## Basic usage of `phpSmug` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Optional, but definitely nice to have, options
$options = [
    'AppName'   => 'My Cool App/1.0 (http://app.com)',
];
$client = new phpSmug\Client("[YOUR_API_KEY]", $options));
$repositories = $client->get('user/[your_username]!albums');
?>
```

From the `$client` object, you can access to all the SmugMug 2.0 API methods.
