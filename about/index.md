{{ site.name }} is a PHP wrapper class for the [SmugMug API](https://smugmug.atlassian.net/wiki/display/API/Home). The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers to quickly and easily interact with the [SmugMug API](https://smugmug.atlassian.net/wiki/display/API/Home) in their applications, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.
