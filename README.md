=============================================

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/lildude/phpSmug/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/lildude/phpSmug?branch=master) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lildude/phpSmug.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lildude/phpSmug)

# :construction: Work In Progress :construction: #

phpSmug 4.0 isn't quite finished yet. I'm still writing tests and am still trying to come up with a nice easy method to get the OAuth request and access tokens.  If you already have your OAuth access tokens, then you're all set and can start using phpSmug right away.

# phpSmug 4.0

A simple object orientated wrapper for the new SmugMug API v2, written in PHP.

**Note: Due to significant changes in the SmugMug API, phpSmug 4.0.0 and later is not backwardly compatible with the SmugMug API v1.x.x releases.**

## Features

* Follows PSR-4 conventions and coding standard: autoload friendly.
* Light and fast thanks to lazy loading of API classes.
* Uses Guzzle for HTTP requests.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.5.0,
* [Guzzle 6](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) library,
* (optional) [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) and [php-cs-fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) to run tests.

## Installation

The new version of `phpSmug` using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).
The first step to use `phpSmug` is to download composer:

```bash
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Then we have to install the dependencies using:

```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```

## Autoload

Now you can use autoloader from Composer by adding a requirement to your project's composer.json:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "lildude/phpSmug": "~4.0"
    }
}
```

`phpSmug` follows the PSR-1, PSR-2 and PSR-4 conventions, which means you can easily integrate `phpSmug` classes loading in your own autoloader.

## Basic usage of `phpSmug` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Optional, but definitely nice to have, options
$options = [
    'AppName'   => 'My Cool App/1.0 (http://app.com)',
    'OAuthSecret' => '[YOUR_OAUTH_SECRET]',
];
$client = new phpSmug\Client("[YOUR_API_KEY]", $options));
$repositories = $client->get('user/[your_username]!albums');
?>
```

From the `$client` object, you can access to all the SmugMug 2.0 API methods.
