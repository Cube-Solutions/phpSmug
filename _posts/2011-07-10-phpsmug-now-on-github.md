Well, finally the day has come for me to put the phpSmug source code onto a public repository.

I've just spent the morning converting my internal Mercurial repo to a Git repo and uploading to [GitHub](http://github.com).  I have also manually transferred all the bugs logged to [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/lildude/phpSmug/issues).

So with [phpSmug out on GitHub](https://github.com/lildude/phpSmug), please feel free to log issues on GitHub or fork the code and submit your changes via pull requests.
