pLadies and gentlemen, welcome to phpSmug's new home - a href="http://phpsmug.com"phpsmug.com/a./ppAs phpSmug has grown to take up a fair amount of my time and it's starting to be used by more and more projects, I thought it's about time it got it's own home, instead of hiding in a corner of my a href="http://www.lildude.co.uk"tech site/a. And this is it./ppIf you're using phpSmug in your application, and want a bit of link love, let me know and I'll add a link back to your application site (and hopefully you'll reciprocate ;-) ). I've not setup a dedicated section for this yet, but as I'm thinking about it and hope to setup a dedicated section in, probably in the sidebar, once I've got a nice list of applications going./ppIt's early days for this site so it may be a little rusty around the edges, but if you spot any problems, leave a comment on this post./p
