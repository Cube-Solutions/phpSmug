Need a quick bit of help, have a quick question, want to show off your app using phpSmug or just want to say thanks for phpSmug?  Please feel free to do so on Twitter using the #phpSmug hash tag.  There's a button on the sidebar too to help you :-)

Provided I'm not on holiday, I'll normally respond, if necessary within a couple of hours of your tweet - normally minutes if during UK business hours :-)
