Just a small minor update to phpSmug that resolves the over zealous [clearCache()](http://phpsmug.com/clearcache-is-over-zealous "") ([Ticket #3](http://phpsmug.com/bugs#3 "")) and some code tidying to get phpSmug a bit closer to being E_STRICT "compliant" ([Ticket #2](http://phpsmug.com/bugs#2 "")).  Sadly we're still tied by PEAR for full compliance, bit for the moment all the code I have control over works with E_STRICT.

As usual, it's available for download from the [download page](http://phpsmug.com/download "").
