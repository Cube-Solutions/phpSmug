Thanks to [MVA for pointing](http://phpsmug.com/phpsmug-2-0#comment-6) out a rather silly mistake I made in phpSmug 2.0 - I wasn't passing the error code correctly to Exception() on line 350 ([Issue #1](https://github.com/lildude/phpSmug/issues/1)).

As this involves something quite crucial, I've released a minor update to rectify this.  This is now available for [download](http://phpsmug.com/download) now.
